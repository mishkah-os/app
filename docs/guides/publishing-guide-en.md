# Publishing Guide (Beginner Friendly)

This guide is written for someone who **only has a working PWA** and no experience with app stores, signing keys, or build pipelines. Follow it step by step.

---

## 0) What you need (short list)

- A working **HTTPS PWA** (already done).
- A **GitHub account**.
- A **Google Play Console** developer account.
- An **Apple Developer Program** account.
- A place to store secrets safely (password manager / encrypted vault).

---

## 1) Create a GitHub account

1. Go to https://github.com and create an account.
2. Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for security.
3. Create a **new repository** (private is recommended).
4. This repository will store:
   - Android wrapper (TWA)
   - iOS wrapper (WKWebView)
   - Build and release workflows

---

## 2) Google Play Console (Android)

### 2.1 Create a Play Console account

1. Go to https://play.google.com/console.
2. Pay the one-time registration fee.
3. Complete the developer profile (name, address, email).

### 2.2 Create the Android app

1. Click **Create app**.
2. Enter the app name, default language, and choose “App”.
3. Set the package name (e.g. `com.yourcompany.app`).
4. Finish the creation wizard.

### 2.3 Create Android signing keys

You need **two keys**:

1) **Upload key** (you control it).
2) **App signing key** (Google controls it).

Steps:

1. Generate a keystore file (upload key):

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore upload.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias upload
```

2. Save:
   - `upload.jks` file
   - keystore password
   - key alias (`upload`)
   - key password

3. In Play Console → **App integrity**:
   - Upload your **upload key** certificate.

> ⚠️ If you lose the upload key, updating the app becomes difficult. Store it securely.

### 2.4 Create a Service Account (for uploads)

1. In Play Console → **Setup → API access**.
2. Create a **Service Account** in Google Cloud.
3. Download the JSON key file.
4. Store it securely. You will use it for automated uploads.

---

## 3) Apple Developer Program (iOS)

### 3.1 Create Apple Developer account

1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/programs/.
2. Enroll in the **Apple Developer Program** (annual fee).
3. Use the same Apple ID consistently.

### 3.2 App Store Connect setup

1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com.
2. Create a new app in **My Apps**.
3. Choose **Bundle ID** (e.g. `com.yourcompany.app`).

### 3.3 Create App Store Connect API key

1. In App Store Connect → **Users and Access → Keys**.
2. Create a new API Key.
3. Download the **.p8** file once.
4. Save:
   - Key ID
   - Issuer ID
   - `.p8` file (base64-encode it later)

### 3.4 Certificates & Provisioning

Most automation tools (Fastlane) will create and manage these for you.
If you do it manually:

1. Create a **Distribution Certificate**.
2. Create a **Provisioning Profile** for App Store.

---

## 4) App assets & store requirements

### Android (Play Store)
- **App icon** (512x512 PNG)
- **Feature graphic** (1024x500)
- **Screenshots** (at least 2 per device type recommended)
- **Privacy Policy URL** (required)

### iOS (App Store)
- **App icon** (1024x1024)
- **Screenshots** for iPhone and iPad
- **Privacy Policy URL** (required)
- **App Review Information** (contact + notes)

> Always prepare high-quality screenshots of your PWA.

---

## 5) Build artifacts

- **Android**: AAB file (Android App Bundle)
- **iOS**: IPA file (signed for App Store)

These files are generated by your build pipeline (GitHub Actions + Fastlane).

### 5.1 Downloading build files (GitHub Actions)

1. Open your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Actions**.
3. Open the latest successful workflow run.
4. Scroll to **Artifacts** and download:
   - Android AAB
   - iOS IPA

Save these files before uploading to the stores.

---

## 6) Versioning & updates

Every update must increase:

- **Android**: `versionCode` and `versionName`
- **iOS**: `CFBundleShortVersionString` and `CFBundleVersion`

Keep a simple release log so you can track changes.

---

## 7) Key rotation (updates)

If you need to update keys later:

- **Android upload key**: request reset in Play Console if lost.
- **Google service account**: create a new key and revoke the old one.
- **Apple API key**: create new key in App Store Connect.

Always update secrets in your CI system when rotating keys.

---

## 8) Privacy policy & compliance

You need a **public privacy policy URL**. Provide it in both stores.

If you are using this platform, a privacy policy can be generated per project.
Example relative URL:

```
/public/projects/:id/privacy
```

You can also use:

```
/public/projects/slug/:slug/privacy
```

## 9) Quick checklist

- [ ] GitHub account + repository created
- [ ] Google Play Console account active
- [ ] Apple Developer Program active
- [ ] Android upload keystore created and stored
- [ ] Google Play service account JSON saved
- [ ] Apple App Store Connect API key saved

## 10) Next steps

Once your wrapper project builds AAB/IPA files:

1. Upload AAB to Play Console.
2. Upload IPA to App Store Connect (TestFlight).
3. Submit for review.
4. Respond to any review feedback.
